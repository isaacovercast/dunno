# dunno
A highly efficient and universal model for performing any calculation, simulation, analysis, or computation. Input is any kind of data in any format. The command line accepts all conceivable parameters. The one reserved parameter is `--turbo` which makes it run __really__ fast. Output is the sentence "I have no idea", and a p-value on the uncertainty.
